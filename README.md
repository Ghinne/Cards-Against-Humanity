## Intro
Cards Against Humanity is a party game in which players complete fill-in-the-blank statements using words or phrases typically deemed as offensive, risqu√© or politically incorrect printed on playing cards. 

## Rules
This game to work propely require at least three people, at least two contenders and only one judge.<br>
On start, each player receive ten white cards.<br>

Player that create match begins as the "Card Czar" and plays a black card, face up.
The other players choose enough cards to fill gaps in black card, trying to form a complete sentence.

The Card Czar receive player choices without knowing who made each choice, then picks the funniest play and whoever submitted it gets one point.

After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and everyone receive enough cards to have ten in their deck.

The part of speech of a white card is a noun or gerund, including both single words and phrase constructions. Black cards are either fill-in-the-blank statements or questions. Both white and black cards break these rules on rare occasions.

The game ends with one or more winners after certain amount of rounds. A point is given to a winner or splitted equally in case of multiple winners.

## Life Cycle diagram
For better understanding i've drawn a diagram.

</p>
As you can see many activities can return to the Choose Nickname activity, this is due to the fact that in case of a failure of an activity or a communication with the database, the game is interrupted and the players return to that activity.
To make the app more orderly and less repetitive I used the DBCommunicator class which, once extended for the different activities, allows communication with the database.
As for the database, I opted to use Cloud Firestore, for the ease of use and the ability to perform more complex queries.
